  System has non-zero total charge: 0.002994
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See

  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.
  



WARNING 1 [file gromacs.top, line 35845]:
  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can
  lead to severe artifacts, such as ions moving into regions with low
  dielectric, due to the uniform background charge. We suggest to
  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.
